This program is a simple expense tracker that calculates the total expenses for a given month. The user is prompted to enter their expenses for four different categories: rent, utilities, groceries, and entertainment. These expenses are stored in a dictionary called "expenses" with the keys "rent", "utilities", "groceries", and "entertainment" and the corresponding values entered by the user.

The function "calculate_expenses" takes in the dictionary of expenses and calculates the total expenses by summing the values in the dictionary. Finally, the total expenses are printed out to the user.

Here is a sample README file for this program:
