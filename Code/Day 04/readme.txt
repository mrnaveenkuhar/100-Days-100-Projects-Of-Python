The code imports the necessary libraries: tkinter for creating the GUI, requests for making HTTP requests, and time for formatting the sunrise and sunset times.

The getWeather function is defined. It takes in a single argument, canvas, which is the main window of the GUI.

The function retrieves the city name from the text field in the GUI and uses it to construct a request to the OpenWeatherMap API.

The API response is retrieved and stored in a variable called json_data.

The function parses the json_data to extract various weather information, such as the current condition, temperature, pressure, humidity, and wind speed. It also extracts the sunrise and sunset times and formats them to be more readable.

The function creates two strings, final_info and final_data, which contain the weather information and sunrise/sunset times, respectively.

The function updates the text of the two labels in the GUI with the final_info and final_data strings.

The main window of the GUI (canvas) is created and configured with a title and size.

A text field is created and added to the GUI, and its font and size are set.

Two labels are created and added to the GUI, and their font and size are set.

The textField is given focus and is bound to the getWeather function, so that the function is called when the user hits the 'Enter' key after entering a city name in the text field.

The canvas.mainloop() call at the end of the code starts an event loop that waits for user interactions and processes them as they occur. This keeps the GUI running until the user closes it.
