100 Days, 100 Python Projects
Welcome to 100 Days, 100 Python Projects! This is a challenge to myself to work on one Python project every day for the next 100 days. The goal is to improve my Python skills and learn new libraries and frameworks.

Each project will be small and manageable, but will also be something that I find interesting and challenging. Some projects will be based on tutorials or examples, while others will be completely original.

Project List
Here is a list of the projects that I plan to work on:

1.A Icon genrator from images
2.A web scraper for extracting data from a website
3.A script for generating random passwords
4.A weather app that shows the current conditions and forecast
5.A game of Tic-Tac-Toe
6.A tool for tracking personal expenses
7.A script for converting text to speech
8.A to-do list manager
9.A script for downloading videos from YouTube
10.A tool for finding and replacing text in multiple files
And many more to come!

Updates
I will be posting updates on my progress every day on my blog. Follow along to see my progress and get inspiration for your own Python projects.

Contributing
If you have any suggestions for projects or ideas for improvements to existing ones, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I'm always looking for ways to learn and improve, and I welcome your input.

Thanks for visiting, and I hope you find this project useful and inspiring!
